## Featured Labs üåü

In this workshop, we'll be focusing on two labs in particular:

### [HTML Image Gallery](html-gallery.md) üñºÔ∏è
Build an interactive image gallery with animations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This lab demonstrates how GitHub Copilot can help with front-end development tasks.

### [Star Wars API Client in Java](starwars-api.md) üöÄ
Create a Java client for the Star Wars API, including DTOs, interfaces, implementations, and tests. This lab showcases GitHub Copilot's ability to understand and implement complex API interactions.

### [Star Wars API Client in Python](starwars-api-python.md) üöÄ
Build a Python client for the Star Wars API, using data classes, abstract base classes, and tests. This lab guides you step-by-step through creating a reusable API client, writing unit tests, and leveraging GitHub Copilot to accelerate development.

### [HTML Image Gallery with MCP](gh-gallery-mcp.md) ü§ñ
Learn how to use GitHub Copilot's agent mode with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to analyze designer mockups, create GitHub issues, and build interactive web applications. This advanced lab demonstrates leveraging MCP tools for repository management and automated testing with Playwright.

### [Build Your Own MCP Server](mcp-server-starter.md) ‚ö°
Create a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) weather server that integrates with VS Code and GitHub Copilot to provide real-time weather forecasts and alerts. This intermediate lab teaches you how to build MCP servers that extend GitHub Copilot's capabilities with external APIs.

### [Other Labs](other-labs.md)
Explore additional hands-on labs covering a variety of languages and scenarios. These labs provide more opportunities to practice and discover the capabilities of GitHub Copilot.
