## How to Choose a Lab ü§î

When selecting a lab for your workshop, consider:

1. **Audience Experience Level**: Choose labs that match the programming experience of your participants
2. **Available Time**: Select labs that fit within your workshop timeframe
3. **Programming Language Preference**: Pick labs that use languages familiar to your audience
4. **Learning Objectives**: Select labs that demonstrate the specific GitHub Copilot features you want to highlight

## Tips for Running Labs Successfully üí°

1. **Pre-workshop Setup**: Ensure all participants have GitHub Copilot access before the workshop
2. **Environment Check**: Verify that participants have the necessary development environments set up
3. **Pair Programming**: Consider having participants work in pairs for more collaborative learning
4. **Time Management**: Set clear timeboxes for each section of the lab
5. **Checkpoints**: Establish checkpoints throughout the lab to ensure everyone is progressing
6. **Assistance**: Have additional facilitators available to help participants who get stuck
7. **Wrap-up Discussion**: After each lab, discuss what was learned and how GitHub Copilot helped

Happy coding with GitHub Copilot! üöÄ
